This directory contains a copy of TinyXML-2, a library that we use to parse
firmware image (FMI) files.  We put a copy of it here in the source code
because some Linux distributions we care about (like Ubuntu 12.04 and
Arch Linux) either do not have a package for this library or their
package is outdated.
