# Building from source

If you want to build p-load from its source code, you can follow these
instructions.  However, for most Windows and Mac OS X users, we recommend
installing this software using our pre-built installers and not trying to build
from source.


## Building from source on Linux

You will need to install tar, wget, gcc, make, CMake,
and libudev.  Most Linux distributions come with a package manager that
you can use to install these dependencies.

On Ubuntu, Raspbian, and other Debian-based distributions, you can install the
dependencies by running:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential tar wget cmake libudev-dev

On Arch Linux, libudev should already be installed, and you can install the
other dependencies by running:

    pacman -Sy base-devel tar wget cmake

For other Linux distributions, consult the documentation of your distribution
for information about how to install these dependencies.

This software depends on the Pololu USB Library version 1.x.x (libusbp-1).  Run
the commands below to download, compile, and install the latest version of that
library on your computer.

    wget https://github.com/pololu/libusbp/archive/v1-latest.tar.gz
    tar -xzf v1-latest.tar.gz
    cd libusbp-v1-latest
    cmake .
    make
    sudo make install

You can test to see if libusbp-1 was installed correctly by running
`pkg-config --cflags libusbp-1`,
which should output something like
`-I/usr/local/include/libusbp-1`.
If it says that libusbp-1 was not found in the pkg-config search path,
retry the instructions above.

Run these commands to download, build, and install p-load:

    wget https://github.com/pololu/p-load/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar -xzf master.tar.gz
    cd p-load-master
    cmake .
    make
    sudo make install

Finally, you will need to install a udev rule to give non-root users permission
to access Pololu USB devices. Run this command from the p-load-master directory:

    sudo cp udev-rules/99-pololu.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

You should now be able to run p-load by typing `p-load` in your shell.

If you get an error about libusbp failing to load (for example,
"cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"), then
run `sudo ldconfig` and try again.  If that does not work, it is likely that
your system does not search for libraries in `/usr/local/lib`
by default.  To fix this issue for your current shell session, run:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

A more permanent solution, which will affect all users of the computer, is to
run:

    sudo sh -c 'echo /usr/local/lib > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local.conf'
    sudo ldconfig


## Building from source on Windows with MSYS2

The recommended way to install this software on Windows is to download our
pre-built installer.  However, you can build it from source using
[MSYS2](http://msys2.github.io/).  If you have not done so already, follow the
instructions on the MSYS2 website to download, install, and update your MSYS2
environment.  In particular, be sure to update your installed packages.

Next, start a shell by selecting "MinGW-w64 Win32 Shell" from your Start menu or
running `mingw32_shell.bat`.  This is the right shell to use for building 32-bit
Windows software.  The resulting software should work on both 32-bit (i686)
Windows and 64-bit (x86_64) Windows.

Run this command to install the required development tools:

    pacman -S base-devel tar mingw-w64-i686-{toolchain,cmake}

If pacman prompts you to enter a selection of packages to install, just press
enter to install all of the packages.

This software depends on the Pololu USB Library version 1.x.x (libusbp-1).  Run
the commands below to download, compile, and install the latest version of that
library into your MSYS2 environment.

    wget https://github.com/pololu/libusbp/archive/v1-latest.tar.gz
    tar -xzf v1-latest.tar.gz
    cd libusbp-v1-latest
    MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL= cmake . -G"MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mingw32
    make install DESTDIR=/

You can test to see if libusbp-1 was installed correctly by running
`pkg-config --cflags libusbp-1`,
which should output something like
`-IC:/msys64/mingw32/include/libusbp-1`.
If it says that libusbp-1 was not found in the pkg-config search path,
retry the instructions above.

Run these commands to build p-load and install it:

    wget https://github.com/pololu/p-load/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar -xzf master.tar.gz
    cd p-load-master
    MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL= cmake . -G"MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/mingw32
    make install DESTDIR=/

Building for 64-bit Windows is also supported, in which case you would use a
"MinGW-w64 Win64 Shell", replace `i686` with `x86_64` in the package names
above, and replace `mingw32` with `mingw64`.


## Building from source on Mac OS X with Homebrew

The recommended way to install this software on Mac OS X is to download our
pre-built installer.  However, you can also build it from source.

First, install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

Then use brew to install the dependencies:

    brew install pkg-config wget cmake

This software depends on the Pololu USB Library version 1.x.x (libusbp-1).  Run
the commands below to download, compile, and install the latest version of that
library on your computer.

    wget https://github.com/pololu/libusbp/archive/v1-latest.tar.gz
    tar -xzf v1-latest.tar.gz
    cd libusbp-v1-latest
    cmake .
    make
    sudo make install

You can test to see if libusbp-1 was installed correctly by running
`pkg-config --cflags libusbp-1`,
which should output something like
`-I/usr/local/include/libusbp-1`.
If it says that libusbp-1 was not found in the pkg-config search path,
retry the instructions above.

Run these commands to build p-load and install it:

    wget https://github.com/pololu/p-load/archive/master.tar.gz
    tar -xzf master.tar.gz
    cd p-load-master
    cmake .
    make
    sudo make install
